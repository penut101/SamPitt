            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>Hello! We are Sigma Alpha Mu, the Psi Chapter at the University of Pittsburgh. We are a social fraternity
                that was founded in 1909. We are a group of diverse individuals who come together to form a brotherhood
                that lasts a lifetime. We are dedicated to our philanthropy, the Alzheimer's Association, and we are
                always looking for ways to give back to the community.</p>
